# AI Tic Tac Toe (5x5)

This project implements an AI player for a 5x5 Tic Tac Toe game using a trained neural network. The AI can play against a human player or a random computer player.

## Features

*   **5x5 Game Board:** A larger Tic Tac Toe board for more complex gameplay.
*   **AI Player:** An intelligent AI opponent powered by a pre-trained PyTorch neural network.
*   **Human Player:** Allows a human to play against the AI or another human.
*   **Random Computer Player:** A basic computer opponent that makes random valid moves.
*   **ONNX Export:** The trained PyTorch model can be exported to ONNX format for deployment or inference with other runtimes.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.x, PyTorch, and ONNX.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saketthakur001/Tic-Tack-Toe-Advanced-AI.git
    cd Tic-Tack-Toe-Advanced-AI
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install torch numpy onnx
    ```

## Project Structure

*   `tic_tac_toe.py`: Contains the core game logic, including the `TicTacToe` class, `HumanPlayer`, `RandomComputerPlayer`, and the main `play` function.
*   `player.py`: Defines the `AIPlayer` class, which uses the trained neural network to determine moves.
*   `model.py`: Defines the `TicTacToeNet` neural network architecture used by the AI.
*   `convert_to_onnx.py`: A utility script to convert the PyTorch model (`.pth`) to ONNX format (`.onnx`).
*   `tictactoe_net.pth`: The pre-trained PyTorch model weights.
*   `tictactoe_net.onnx`: The pre-trained model in ONNX format (generated by `convert_to_onnx.py`).
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Run the Game

To play against the AI, run the `tic_tac_toe.py` script:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

The game will prompt you for your moves. The AI will play as 'X' and the human player as 'O' by default in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block. You can modify this block to change players or roles.

## How the AI Works

The AI player (`AIPlayer` in `player.py`) uses a pre-trained neural network (`TicTacToeNet` from `model.py`) to evaluate the game board and predict the best next move. The network takes a flattened representation of the 5x5 board as input and outputs scores for each possible move. The AI prioritizes winning moves and blocking opponent's winning moves before consulting the neural network's output.
